# Classify

Is a web app that was built as an experiment to run both tensorflow and caffe, it classifies images using both frameworks and two different models i.e Inception(using tensorflow) and AlexNet(using caffe). The frontend is made with jqurey and the backend was made using Pythons flask framework



# Inception Trained on imagenet dataset

http://download.tensorflow.org/models/image/imagenet/inception-2015-12-05.tgz ----- To download the inception model


# Alexnet trained on places dataset

  https://github.com/CSAILVision/places365/blob/master/deploy_alexnet_places365.prototxt 
  http://places2.csail.mit.edu/models_places365/alexnet_places365.caffemodel 
  
  After you downloaded these two files please place them in the same folder and rename it as 'models_places' or replace the PlacesPath
